# TripleTen_SupervisedLearning

This project focuses on developing a predictive model for Beta Bank, which is experiencing a gradual loss of customers. Retaining existing clients has been identified as more cost-effective than acquiring new ones, prompting the need for a solution to anticipate customer churn.

The objective is to predict whether a customer is likely to leave the bank in the near future. The available dataset contains historical information on customer behavior and contract terminations.

The task is to build a classification model optimized for the highest possible F1 score. To meet the project requirements, the model must achieve an F1 score of at least 0.59 on the test set. In addition to the F1 score, the AUC-ROC metric should also be calculated and compared to evaluate model performance.
